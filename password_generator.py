#  Password generator

# function to create a random password
# We should define some random variables. A first variable, p1, draws a number from (0.4, 0.7) that defines
# the proportion of letters. If the password length is n, the proportion of letters will be given by int(p1*n).
# The latter, p2, is uniformly drawn from (0.15, 0.3) and defines the proportion of special characters.
# Moreover, we draw uniformly a variable, p, from (0,1), such that if it is bigger than 0.5, the appended letter is
# uppercase, otherwise it is lowercase. Once the password has been created, we shuffle all its characters randomly.
# Note that the minimum length of the password must be 7 and the previous intervals guarantee that the password contains
# all of letters, characters and numbers with no exclusions. For example, even in the case p2 = 0.15 and n=7,
# we would have at least b=1 special character.
